# Just Ordinary People ðŸ˜‚

## Introduction
Hello there! Welcome to our corner of GitHub. We're just a bunch of ordinary folks trying to make our mark in the vast digital landscape. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious newcomer, we're glad to have you here!

## About Us
I am an individual with a strong interest in the world of technology. Despite my educational background originating from a pesantren (Islamic boarding school), my interest in technology has driven me to explore further in this field. Currently, I am pursuing my education at Duta Bangsa University, where I strive to develop my understanding and skills in various aspects of technology.
